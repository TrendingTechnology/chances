If you’re going to have to make a decision, try to make sure it’s between a good choice and a great choice.

These are not always the options that life presents to us. As I have written before, [you always have more than two choices to make](/consider-the-rest). But if we can work hard enough to position ourselves for the right opportunities, I believe we can position ourselves so that the decisions get less difficult and less consequential when it comes to matters of our personal and professional growth.
